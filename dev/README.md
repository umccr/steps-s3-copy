# Deploy

CDK for deploying manually to UMCCR dev.

See accompanying dev test suite for some code
that exercises this as deployed to dev.

## Copy report preview (local)

The HTML is generated by `createHtmlReport()`, defined in`summarise-copy-lambda/create-html-report.ts` and then It’s called by the summarise-copy Lambda handler (`summarise-copy-lambda/summarise-copy-lambda.ts`)

To preview the report locally (without running the full Step Functions workflow), run the dev helper script:

```bash
npx tsx packages/steps-s3-copy/lambda/summarise-copy-lambda/preview-copy-report.ts
```

This writes `dev_copy_report.html` next to `preview-copy-report.ts` and then tries to open it in your browser (best-effort).
